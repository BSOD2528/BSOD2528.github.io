                    The Earth, it is truly a spectacular planet which is currently the home to many millions of species. With immense diversity, we must be thankful to God (if
                    you're believer of God) / Earth (as you're an athiest lol). Yet, since the inception of humans, the Earth has been doomed. We have always used it and never
                    been thankful to it. People are greedy and the want for more has been destroying us. Sorry, *is* destroying us is the right phrase to be used.

                    Im my honest opinion, humans in general suck. They're worthless piece of life that never get satisfied in their life times. The main reasons that has caused

                    Think carefully with no disturbance around you; you'll realise you've been comitting one of the biggest crimes out there which isn't even listed in your country's
                    constitution! It's painful to know that we can't change this.

                    <b>Negligence</b> - we never cared to take strict measures regarding the effluents left by many corporates. I mean yeah you can question me by asking "Aren't you
                    literally using a PC and a website to share this information??????"; true. Its being put to good use. Ofcourse, technology is not the point I'm blaming, its the fact
                    that we never really took any good care in taking care of what we discard and how we do it.

                    <b>Ignorance</b> - we have always been ignorant in many situations. Global warming has been there since the mid 1800s, yet what have done as humans? Yes ofcourse,
                    we relied on the technology to improve itself and become much better, but as layman, what have you done? Think about it. Buying vehicles when its not a need and
                    rather a want, using a car for a single person omg! The list goes on!

                    <b>Arrogance</b> - caused by the money earned by the coporates from the layman and showcasing dominance and arrogance against the little ones that try to do
                    something good. Not only the coporates, even single beings out there do this for the power, greediness of power and immense headweight is what caused our species
                    to one of the most arrogant ones out there.

                    I mean okay, in all fairness, to be professional, we're screwed. Soon we'll have no water, no space for homes as we're overpopulating our planet. I don't even
                    want to write this part, its just scary honestly.

                    Well, this is where things get difficult. Its like walking for the first time. It also sounds really ridiculous, but hey if you want water to drink then you
                    need to follow this. I might be arrogant here but ehehe.

                    To brief things out, we need to stop essentials like soap and toothpaste as we don't need it to survive. Soap does nothing but remove the oil from skin, but
                    does it make us clean? No. We then need to stop wasting water as much as possible. We need to plant more trees, stop one car one person, use public transport
                    more, make everything more efficient. We genuienly need to educate the mass population in such ways that you know they'll listen <i>*winks*</i>

                    The list keeps going on! I've given a good description regarding this in my notion sub-page. <a href="https://togethertomorrow.notion.site/togethertomorrow/Environment-Dashboard-13e77f7fde5845dfa765da98069efadd">
                    Click here</a> to know more. Its a small initiative I've taken to gather people regarding environmental issues. Upon more people gathering we can have a good
                    voice against the government to take the strictest measures in order to save our lives. Remember, this is not for today, but for tomorrow.
