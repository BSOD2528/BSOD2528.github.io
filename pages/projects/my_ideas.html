                    I am a visionary, with an infinite wellspring of creative inspiration &#128128;. Just joking, as of now I only have three major ideas when it comes to projects which are purely
                    based on software. The following explain what they are in detail:

                        The idea of creating a simple credential manager popped up in my head as soon as I was fluent with OOP in Python. Its a simple class which creates an instance for a user to sign up
                        to the application and store his/her credentials. However, the entire application built in Python was CLI based. To make this GUI, I got to know that C# was the best language for
                        Windows applications.

                        Click here for <code><a href="../../extra/credential_manager.py" class="no-href-styles">credential_manager.py</a></code> and here for the sample
                        <code><a href="../../extra/example_config.env" class="no-href-styles">config.env</a></code> utilised for starting up the entire application. FYI, it doesn't have all the features. Just
                        the bare bones for now.

                        However, I recently learnt that does the same thing and is also open source &#128511;. I was also planning on making mine open source and lmao, BitWarden is also built on C#.
                        But screw them, I'm still going to make this application soon lol.

                        My father is keen on investing in jewelry. He regularly visits our local jewelry shop's website in order to check the price. I was wondering if I could make his life easier by making
                        a simple app which sends him regular notifications so that he can check the price. The app should be GUI and user friendly too. So yeah. Kotlin is the go to for Android development.

                    <p class="indent the-white-para">
                        The app would be open sourced, yet it wouldn't be available for download on the Google Play store, as it literally would be webscraping lmao.

                        It should be pretty evident by now that this website may ne be upto the mark when compared to many other websites out there. Design and styling are the main key factors where I have to
                        improve myself alot. As of now, a basic live website will be present (which is this indeed). Whenever I get time to learn front-end frameworks I shall be updating accordingly.
