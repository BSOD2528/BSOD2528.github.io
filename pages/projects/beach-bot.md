# Beach-Bot
A collaborative project with [Zeus432](https://github.com/Zeus432) to make people who're unaware of Python or discord.py feel less intimidated by the sheer ocean of concepts which are required to create a discord bot
using discord bot.

However, since discord.py has had many more advancements to the library, this has been archived. You can still refer the code in the provided GitHub link.
