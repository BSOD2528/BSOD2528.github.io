We've all known about abstraction right? Well, thats provided you're aware of the concept of <span class="cb">Object Orient Programming</span>. Well if you aren't, it basically allows you to create
templates and create multiple instances of the same template each with its own unique data.

Similarly, life is all about abstraction, we've just never realised it.

## Atomic Scale
Remember back in our youngest school days we all learnt about "atoms" being the smallest unit of life! These all group together to form elements, which further form molecules which form materials
and so on.

A single class is constantly sub-classed and all its properties being inherited.

Since we have knowledge on all the levels of abstraction that has occured, we're able to create products with ease and intuition provides us all the answers.

## Macroscopic Scale
Similarly, we humans also live in abstraction. We just don't realise it. I'm quoting <span class="cb">[Mr. Robot](https://www.google.com/search?q=mr+robot)</span> here. There are people living out
there who play god without our permission. These are the people who want to watch the world burn and have everything under their control.

Just think about it, we have different types of humans. It's not that I'm being racist or castist here, we humans naturally have the intention to segregate and judge accordingly. We have humans based
on multiple classes, not just a single class. Each individual is a sub-class inherited from multiple other classes like:
- race
- nationality
- age
- gender
- education
- likes and dislikes
- religion
- career

## Where am I going with this?
It just struck me one day while I was bored at the beach at 8pm to be exact. My mind was thinking and realised that we're all just objects. Everything is an object which has its own attributes and
methods.

For example, when I'm creating music in a DAW, it's genuinely difficult to understand how that works in terms of raw binary. At the end of the day, my CPU is processing just <span class="cb">1s</span> 
and <span class="cb">0s</span>. Even if I know that DAW was written in a language, which is further being compiled. It's all mindblowing as it happens in few milli-seconds. 

The amount of abstraction that has occured is just insane. Programmers don't know what the raw machine code is going to like, however they know what they're doing in that particular language.

Not every subject has intuition as far as I'm aware.

We reshape sand into teeny-tiny little semiconductor chips which further conduct electricity and control the entire world now.

Similarly stuff goes on inside our bodies and other living things. Everything is inter-related yet to distinct.

# Conclusion
Enjoy and appreciate life because everything happens so quickly. The amount of time it takes to contemplate the entire process is an eternal. Once one finds out the purpose of why this happens, he
won't be alive. Cause the amount of ecstasy released from his brain.

No one would be able to understand or even listen to his rant. Its a huge amount of knowledge. 

Quoting [Avvaiyar](https://www.google.com/search?q=avvaiyar) here here: <span class="cb">‡Æï‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æï‡Øà ‡ÆÆ‡Æ£‡Øç ‡ÆÖ‡Æ≥‡Æµ‡ØÅ.  ‡Æï‡Æ≤‡Øç‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Æ§‡ØÅ ‡Æâ‡Æ≤‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Æµ‡ØÅ.
</span>

This means, we have only learnt a handful of sand, there's still an entire world remaining to be learnt.

You might be wondering whether if I was high at the time of writing, but no. I have my 4th semester exams in a week and this is what I'm focusing on üóøüóø.
