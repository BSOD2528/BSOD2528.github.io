From a company I used to respect, to not so total trash. There are justifications for both.

# Context
I own a Samsung Galaxy S22 bought in October 2022. Literally the year when they launched the phone. I like small phones as their fun to hold and its small. 

Fast forwarding to October 2024, my battery bulges and I go to the service center to get it repaired and they changed the battery, however told me there's a 
small wire that needs to be bought. 

Didn't get that fixed until <span class="cb">6th Jan. 2025</span> cause they delayed the wire delivery for 2 weeks 
and I had continuous exams. 

Since I didn't use my phone for the past few months, I updated everything and upon finishing up the December 2024 security patch, a green line appearsðŸ™‚.

# Service Request
Apparently, only S21 and S22 Ultra models are allowed for display replacement done for free by Samsung which was announced back in 2024 due to multiple cases.

As a S series customer, they initally denied my request. Upon further talking talking talking .... they finally approved it.

# Why I Hate Samsung?
As a S series customer, I wasn't even valued one bit. Then why on Earth am I paying nearly 800 to 900 USD (I paid 50k INR due to multiple offers) for a phone? No point.

The point is value. Of course this cannot be applied everywhere, for example on humanitarian grounds, but this a product. Not even a life-saving product, merely a want.
Any phone would suffice todays needs.

One things for sure, next time I'm going to get a Pixel.
