# About Me

My name is Vishal Srivatsava AV from <span class="hover-flag">India<span class="flag">&#127470;&#127475;</span></span>!. I'm currently studying bachelors in electronics and communication engineering.

VLSI is a field which I genuinely admire. I'm striving hard so that I can pursue my masters in this beautiful field!

## Misc
In the online world, I'm predominantely called as <span class="cb">bsod2528</span>. I love computers so I kept "bsod" as I liked errors. 2528 was my discriminator when that was a thing on
Discord. 

I love Christian Bale and Cillian Murphy (100% straight) from the bottom of my heart as they're fine actors who portray the meaning and the essence on the screen in the most unique way.

## Hobbies

I like to game, code, listen to a lot of music, and make decent music. I also speed cube, current personal best is at <span class="cb">11.96</span> seconds. I watch a ton of movies.

### Favourite Games

When it comes to classic games, I love <span class="gta">GTA V</span>, <span class="fc">Far Cry 3</span>, <span class="gta">GTA San Andreas</span>, <span class="mc">Minecraft</span>, <span class="cb">CS GO</span> (not the best, but I was good), and FPS in general.

As time goes, one matures. Take a look at my steam &#x1f440: [Quite lifeless behaviour](https://steamcommunity.com/id/bsod2528/)


### Favourite Musicians

My lastfm and spotify say them all, Hans Zimmer, Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, and Joji take the first three places on the leaderboard.
