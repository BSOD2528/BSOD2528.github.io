A simple portfolio made purely using HTML and CSS which were subsequently learnt in order to make this a reality.

While the old [Jekyll TeXT](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) theme did serve the purpose, it wasn't authentic as I was using someone else's theme.

The result of that is this beautiful website lol. Its a top and side nav bar :moyai:. Uhh it has cool hovering animations so far lol.

As of now, this website doesn't involve any framework. I do have plans for upgrading the website which improve the looks and the UI on the whole.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio! Feel free to contact me to learn more or view my other projects.
