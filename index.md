# Hello World
Welcome to my world! This is a place where I blog sometimes regarding mostly on technology and the environment. Enjoy your stay ✨✨

## Tech Stack
A small legend for the below list:
<br>[ <span class="diff-knowledge">+</span> -- how much I know ]
<br>[ <span class="diff-practical">-</span> -- how much I've used ]
<br> all values are out of 6.
{:.info}

I learn new stuff as I'm either interested in them or I need to use them in my life. Languages and stuff
